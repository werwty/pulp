Quickstart
==========

This guide will walk you through the creation of a development environment using an example playbook and an example Vagrantfile. The result is a Vagrant virtual machine running Pulp from source code checked out on the host machine.

Host Requirements:
------------------

* Python 3.5
* Ansible 2.2

Other requirements vary depending on how you configure your Vagrantfile. If using ``Vagrantfile.example``, install vagrant, ansible, and the SSHFS plugin for vagrant. SSHFS will be used to share your local code directory with the deployed virtual machine::

    $ sudo dnf install vagrant ansible vagrant-sshfs vagrant-libvirt

Optional ProTip: The ``vagrant-hostmanager`` plugin is handy. If installed on the host and enabled in the Vagrantfile, the Pulp server will be accessable at ``dev.example.com``::

    $ sudo dnf install vagrant-hostmanager


Put Source Code on your Host
----------------------------

Use the :ref:`getsource` guide to put the code into a development directory on your *host machine*. If you use one of the default playbooks, ``pulp_devel_dir`` is set for you, see `variables`_.

Provision a Vagrant Virtual Machine
-----------------------------------

Create a Vagrantfile in the root of the ``devel`` repository by copying ``Vagrantfile.example``.::

    $ cp Vagrantfile.example Vagrantfile

Have a look at your Vagrantfile, notice that you can choose one or more ansible playbooks::

    # Minimal developer install of Pulp
    ansible.playbook = "ansible/minimal-playbook.yml"

    # Developer install with Batteries Included.
    # ansible.playbook = "ansible/example-playbook.yml"

With a ``Vagrantfile`` in place, use the basic Vagrant commands to get started.

vagrant up
    Spin up a new Vagrant machine and provision as specified by the Vagrantfile.

vagrant destroy
    Remove the vm.

vagrant reload
    Reboot the vm.

vagrant provision
    Reprovision. For the default Vagrantfile, this will rerun the Ansible playbooks.

vagrant ssh
    Connect to your Vagrant machine with ssh.


.. note::

    If you are using ``example-playbook.yml``, connecting to Vagrant will greet you with a message of the day and some helpful tips to get started.
